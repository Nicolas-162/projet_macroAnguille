# Readme

Here's the readme for the project Â« Macro Anguilles Â».

## Installation

First you need to install a few tools:

-   Xampp: it contains the Apache server (Web) and the MySQL server.
-   HeidiSQL: a database manager, great because of the ability to import large database from a script which can be tricky with PHPMyAdmin.
-   NodeJS: it is a React project how can you build such a project without it ðŸ˜…

## Requirements

### Database import

You need to import the database with HeidiSQL. The script to execute is located in the Â« requirements Â» folder.

### PHP

In the Â« php Â» folder you'll find all the scripts used. You want to move it in the Â« htdocs Â» folder located in the folder where Xampp is installed.
The Â« Gestion_turbinage Â» folder should also be placed in htdocs.

### Run the project

To run the project you need to type the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nicolas-162/projet_macroAnguille.git
cd projet_macroAnguille
npm install #install all the packages needed
npm run dev
```

### Build the project

-   Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

The built project will be by default placed in the the Â« dist Â» folder.

-   Create a new folder in the Â« htdocs Â» directory. The folder must have the same name as the React project otherwise it won't run.
-   Place the content of Â« dist Â» folder in the newly created folder in htdocs.
